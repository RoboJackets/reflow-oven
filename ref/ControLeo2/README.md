This is the GitHub source code repository for ControLeo2.  ControLeo2 is an Arduino Leonardo controller with quad relay outputs used to control reflow ovens.

In this folder are:
1. README - this file
2. A "ControLeo2” folder.  This is an Arduino library and examples for ControLeo2

To install the ControLeo2 library, please refer to:

Reflow Wizard
=============
* 1.0  Initial public release. (21 October 2014)
* 1.1  Bug fixes (30 December 2014)
*      - Oven temperature might not reach configured maximum temperature
*      - Adjusted values so learning happens faster
*      - Other minor improvements
* 1.2  Improvements (6 January 2014)
*      - Take temperature readings every 0.125s and average them.  Fixes errors
*        generated by noise from convection fans
*      - Refined learning mode so learning should happen in fewer runs
*      - Improved loop duration timer to enhance timing
*      - Moved some strings from RAM to Flash (there is only 2.5Kb of RAM)
* 1.3  No user-facing changes (19 January 2013)
*      - Fixed compiler warnings for Arduino 1.5.8
* 1.4  Added support for servos (6 February 2015)
*      - When using a servo, please connect a large capacitor (e.g. 220uF, 16V)
*        between +5V and GND to avoid a microcontroller reset when the servo
*        stall current causes the voltage to drop.  Small servos may not need
*        a capacitor
*      - Connect the servo to +5V, GND and D3
*      - The open and close positions are configured in the Settings menu
*      - The oven door will open when the reflow is done, and close at 50C.
*        The door is also closed when ControLeo2 is turned on.

Oven door servo:
================
Version 1.4 adds support for a servo to open the oven door when the reflow is done.  The door should be opened 1” - 2” so the temperature drop does not exceed 6°C/second.  Small servos (like the TG9) are probably powerful enough to open the oven door. Large servos (like the MG945 with metal gears) will work too - with a caveat.  Large servos mean large stall currents which can cause the voltage to the microcontroller to drop and cause a brown-out reset.  Regardless of the servo used, it is recommended that you place a large capacitor (e.g. 220uF, 16V) between +5V and GND.

The power supply used to power ControLeo2 should provide at least 1000mA, but preferably 1.5A to even 2A.  The power supplies provided in the ControLeo2 oven build kit are 2A.
